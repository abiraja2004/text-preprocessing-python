# Text Processing: Python

This project actually consists of several smaller projects, each using Python for text analysis.

The first project examines several Gutenberg files and compares them for similarity.

The second project analyzes job postings for a single company across different platforms.

The third project analyses job postings for a specific search criteria across multiple job websites.

Lastly, tools that made these tasks easier will be included or referenced.

## Project 1: Preprocessing

The end analysis involves a cosine comparison between documents. The files were imported, ported and tokenized using the natural language tookit (nltk).

## Project 2: Comparing a Single Company's Posting Jobs Across Different Websites

This project ports the first project into a similar comparison.

## Project 3: Qualifications for a Job Description

Using the search engine for LinkedIn, indeed.com and glassdoor.com, a search term would bring up specific job postings. This project compares scrapings of those different job descriptions and requirements.
